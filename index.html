<p class="first"><cite>Dive Into Python 3</cite> will cover Python 3 and its differences from Python 2.  Compared to the original <cite><a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive Into Python</a></cite>, it will be about 50% revised and 50% new material.  I will publish drafts online as I go.  The final version will be published on paper by Apress.  The book will remain online under the <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY-3.0</a> license.
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve written so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="table-of-contents.html">Table of contents</a> (<strong>not finalized</strong>)
<li><a href="your-first-python-program.html">Chapter 1. Your first Python program</a>
<li><a href="case-study-porting-chardet-to-python-3.html">Chapter 20. Case study: porting <code>chardet</code> to Python 3</a>
<li><a href="porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.html">Appendix A. Porting code to Python 3 with <code>2to3</code></a>
</ul>

<p>There is a <a href="http://hg.diveintopython3.org/">changelog</a>, a <a rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://hg.diveintopython3.org/atom-log">feed</a>, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=%22Dive+Into+Python+3%22&amp;sort=new">discussion on Reddit</a>.  During development, you can download the book by cloning the Mercurial repository:
<pre><samp class="prompt">you@localhost:~$ </samp><kbd>hg clone http://hg.diveintopython3.org/ diveintopython3</kbd></pre>
<p>The final version will be downloadable as HTML and PDF.

As I write this, the year is 2009, and the internet is STILL a battleground of so-called "intellectual property" disputes.  Some people would have you believe that without proper financial incentives, music, literature, and software would disappear.  After all, who would make music if they can't make money on it?  Who would write?  Who would program?

I know the answer.  The answer is that musicians will make music, not because they can make money, but because musicians are the people who can't not make music.  Writers will write because they can't not write.  Most of the people you think of as artists are really just showmen.  They collect a paycheck and go home at 5 o'clock.  That's not art, that's commerce.

I've been programming since 1983 and releasing my code under Free Software licenses since 1993.  I've been writing and publishing under Free Content licenses since 2000.  I can't imagine not doing this.  If you can imagine yourself not doing what you're doing, do something else.  Do whatever it is you can't not do.
